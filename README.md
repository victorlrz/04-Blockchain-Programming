Command
To compile a Truffle project, change to the root of the directory where the project is located and then type the following into a terminal:

truffle compile
Upon first run, all contracts will be compiled. Upon subsequent runs, Truffle will compile only the contracts that have been changed since the last compile. If you'd like to override this behavior, run the above command with the --all option.
